Meaning of the CSR control and status bits
=============================================

Bit 00: TB Transmit buffer memory busy
	It is set to 1 by the RTI when data has been written to the tx_buffer memory
	It is set to 0 by the BC after data has been read from the tx_buffer memory
	Writing any value to this bit resets the tx_buffer memory pointer

Bit 01: RB Receive buffer memory busy
	It is set to 1 by the BC when data has been written to the rx_buffer memory
	It is set to 0 by the RTI after data has been read from the rx_buffer memory
	Writing any value to this bit resets the rx_buffer memory pointer

Bit 02: INV Invalid Message
	This bit is set to 1 by the end-user equipment when it is sent a junk message

Bit 03: RL Reset line
	This bit represents the end-user equipment reset line, the BC can clear it.
	It also gets set on a master reset.

Bit 04: INE Interrupt enabled
	When set to 1 the end user equipment can be interrupted

Bit 05: INT Interrupt end-user equipment
	The BC sets this bit to 1 to interrupt the end-user equipment.
	The RTI sets it back to 0 after the interrupt has been serviced.

Bit 06: RTP Reset the tx_buffer memory pointer
	The BC writes to this bit when it wants to set the tx_buffer memory pointer to 0

Bit 07: RRP Reset the rx_buffer memory pointer
	The BC writes to this bit when it wants to set the rx_buffer memory pointer to 0

Bit 08: BC Bus Controler
	Not implemented

Bit 09: BCR Bus controler request
	Not implemented

Bit 10: LRR Local remote request
	This bit is set to 1 by the end-user equipment when it wants to go into local

Bit 11: NEM Non Expected Message
	Set by the BC or the end-user equipment
	Its not used

Bit 12: BRD Broadcast disable
	Not implemented

Bit 13: LOC Local
	This bit is set to 1 by the BC when it wants the end-user equipment to go into local

Bit 14: TES Test
	Set by the BC all G64 lines go tri-state high impedance

Bit 15: OPE Operational
	The 5v is present

=============================================
Meaning of the STR status bits
=============================================

Bit 00: TF Terminal Flag
	Set after a power fail/restore, cleared on read

Bit 01: DBC Dynamic Bus Control
	Not implemented

Bit 02: SF Sub-system (end-user) flag
	Its the logical OR od CSR.INV and CSR.RL

Bit 03: BUY Busy
	Its the logical OR of CSR.LOC and CSR.TES

Bit 04: BRO Broadcast
	Not implemented

Bit 05: TB tx_buffer busy
	Its just CSR.TB

Bit 06: RB rx_buffer busy
	Its just CSR.RB

Bit 07: TIM Timeout
	Set by the RTI when the end-user equipment has not responded

Bit 08: SR Service request
	It the logical OR of CSR.LRR and CSR.NEM

Bit 09: INS Instrumentation
	Not implemented

Bit 10: ME Message Error
	Set when a transmission error occured

Bit 11..15: RTI Address
	    5-bit RTI number set on card switches 0..31
	    Address 0 means broadcast (never use it)
