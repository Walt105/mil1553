This is the release candidate for the next version of the mil1553 driver.


This branch RC

1) Hardware polling ON/OFF improvements
   Rather than return 0xFFFFFFFF return the value mdev->up_rtis
   Hardware polling can then be turned off

2) The driver installation should perform a hard reset on all RTI cards
   Many of the acquisition errors dissapeared after resetting the RTI cards

   --- After having talked with Nicolas, we have decided this operation can
   --- only be performed safley via a manual command from the test program.
   --- Its just too dangerous to automate, the DSC reboot could be for
   --- unrelated reasons than the mil1553.

3) Slowing down the acquisitions reduces the error rate
   I will add a controllable wait time into the libraries

4) The tx_queue is over complicated and not used, get rid of it.
