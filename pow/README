This version works with the new mill1553 driver written by Julian Lewis
It is supposed to replace the older version.

Here the RT task and procos DO NOT convert packets into network and back to host
format. This is the job of the quick data library that knows the structures
from their protocol numbers. The same library is used by the test program.

About running on multiple bus controllers in paralell; the structure of the RT task
needs to be modified so that each BC is driven by a thread.

About how to compile and test....

On cs-ccr-dev1:
# cd /acc/src/dsc/co/em/pow/NEW_MILL1553_VERSION
# make CPU=L865 clean install deliver

Then rebuild nodal for your front-end
# cd /acc/src/dsc/tst/cfc-864-cdv4/
# make clean
# make install

Then ssh cfc-864-cdv4  -l root:

# killall pci-powvrt

# prio 45 pci-powvrt &

# gdb nodal
  b send_quick_data
  b get_quick_data
  run
 > run /user/heinze/test_powv
