This version works with the new mill1553 driver written by Julian Lewis
It is supposed to replace the older version.

Here the RT task and procos DO NOT convert packets into network and back to host
format. This is the job of the quick data library that knows the structures
from their protocol numbers. The same library is used by the test program.

About running on multiple bus controllers in paralell; the structure of the RT task
needs to be modified so that each BC is driven by a thread.
