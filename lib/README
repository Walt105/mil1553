There are 3 layers of library:

libmil1553
This deals with the cbmia PCI bus controller module. I should rename it libbc. It got its name
from the driver which is also called mil1553. I should have called it cbmia.
This library is the only one that calls the driver.

librti
This implements RTI card support and calls the above libmill1553 library for services

libquick
This implements the quick data library support for power-supplies. This library calls librti
for services.
