/**

/**
 * This code was derrived by experimenting with the hardware.
 * The way data must be serialized and deserialized is not always symetric.
 * It was quite a challenge to find out what I needed to do to make things work.
 * I would strongly advise against anyone using the raw data IO calls on a power supply.
 * I have added the correct logic for serializing the power supply data structures.
 *
 * In conclusion unless you are some sort of pervert don't even think about calling
 *    mil1553_send_raw_quick_data or mil1553_get_raw_quick_data
 *
 * Instead use
 *    mil1553_send_quick_data or mil1553_get_quick_data
 * which do the correct conversions for you to and from native format
